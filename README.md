### Dependecies
`curl` and `unzip` are required to execute the script successfully.

### Details
Every script invocation will:
* trigger a download of the auto-detected package
* save it to  `~/.duckdb/latest/bin/duckdb-latest` (overriding what was there)
* execute a couple of SQL statement to verify installation
* add installation folder to the PATH (so it can then be executed)

And whenever you want to grab a newer version, just invoke
```
duckdb-update
```
